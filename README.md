ICBT Campus Information Portal
                  There is a campus called ICBT Campus located in Colombo also known as International College of Business and Technology, is a leading private sector higher education provider in Sri Lanka. So, my project is connected to this campus. I created a web-based information portal for this campus. Access to timely and reliable information is crucial for both staff and students in the modern academic setting. Delivering updates, course information and communication via conventional channels like notice boards or dispersed emails is a common problem for college and campuses. This frequently results in misunderstandings, gaps in knowledge or trouble finding pertinent resources. The campus information portal, a centralized online platform that arranges and disseminates important information in an orderly, user-friendly and secure manner was created in response to these worries.
